  <h3>🔎 How This Was Verified</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>We identified the main SUPDOG-WBNB liquidity pool on PancakeSwap V1.</li>
    <li>We checked the LP token address: <code>0x6096bd...77da</code>.</li>
    <li>100% of those LP tokens were sent to a smart contract: <code>0x9a9A8d...26f9</code>.</li>
    <li>In the lock transaction, the unlock time is set to <strong>Unix 9999999999</strong>.</li>
    <li>This translates to <strong>November 20, 2286</strong> — verifiable on BscScan.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>💡 Common Questions</h3>
  <strong>Can anyone unlock it early?</strong>  
  <p>No. The LP tokens are locked in a smart contract without public access. No wallet can withdraw before the unlock date unless the contract itself is flawed — which appears unlikely based on current data.</p>

  <strong>Why was “79 years” used originally?</strong>  
  <p>This was likely a conservative or symbolic figure used in early marketing. The actual unlock date is over 260 years away (not just 79).</p>

  <h3>⚠️ Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>This verification is based on publicly viewable blockchain data on BscScan. While the lock appears valid and time-based, users should always verify smart contract security independently and recognize that unforeseen vulnerabilities may exist in any blockchain system.</p>
